## Hi, I'm Harpreet 🧠

## Focus
I am interested in NeuroAI, biomedical machine learning, and biologically inspired computational systems.
I have a background in biomedical sciences and I enjoy building models inspired by biological systems, implementing them with cognitive simulations, analysing neural activity, and blending neuroscience with computational creativity.

Artificial intelligence can mimic - or learn from - biological intelligence. 
My goal is to gather data, insights, and eventually develop systems that support neurological function, or help scaffold cognitive deficit caused by any sort of neuropathology. 

## What I Work On
- EEG signal processing and seizure detection
- Neural dynamics and biologically inspired models
- Artificial memory and cognitive systems
- Machine learning for biomedical data

## Projects
- EEG Seizure Detection – ML pipeline for seizure classification from EEG

## Tools & Skills
- Python
- NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn
- Signal processing
- Machine learning
- Computational neuroscience

## Learning Philosophy
I build projects as learning tools, documenting both successes and limitations to develop deep understanding.
I am self-taught, and constructive criticism is always welcomed, if it helps me grow.
