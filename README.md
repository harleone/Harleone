## 🧠 About Me 
Hello everybody, I am Harpreet - I find myself in the endevour to explore the intersection between **NeuroAI**, **Machine Learning**, and **Neuropathologies**.

I have a background in biomedical sciences and I enjoy building models inspired by biological systems, implementing them with cognitive simulations, analysing neural activity, and blending neuroscience with computational creativity.

Artifical intelligence can mimic - or learn from - biological intelligence. 
My goal is to gather data, gather insights, and eventually develop systems that support neurological function, or help scaffold cognitive deficit caused by any sort of neuropathology. 

I am self-taught, and constructuve criticism is always welcomed, if it helps me grow.
